\section{\texttt{unary\_plus\_functor} (struct)}
A \textit{FunctorBase} (see \cite{functors}) with one template parameter $\texttt{A}$ followed by the \texttt{ENABLED} template parameter.
Its specializations are unary \textit{Functor}s representing the operation $\texttt{+a}$.

\subsection{\texttt{unary\_plus} (function)}
This library provides a function to invoke the \texttt{unary\_plus\_functor}.
A possible implementation is given by\newline
\texttt{template\textlangle typename A\textrangle\newline
auto\newline
unary\_plus(const A\& a)\newline
noexcept(noexcept(unary\_plus\_functor\textlangle A\textrangle()(a)))\newline
-> decltype(unary\_plus\_functor\textlangle A\textrangle()(a))\newline
\{ return unary\_plus\_functor\textlangle A\textrangle()(a); \}}

\subsection{\texttt{operator+} (unary operator)}
This library provides a unary plus operator overload to invoke the \texttt{unary\_plus\_functor}.
A possible implementation is given by\newline
\texttt{template\textlangle typename A\textrangle\newline
auto\newline
operator+(const A\& a)\newline
noexcept(noexcept(unary\_plus(a)))\newline
-> decltype(unary\_plus(a))\newline
\{ return unary\_plus(a); \}}
