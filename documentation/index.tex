\section{\texttt{division\_by\_zero\_error} (struct)}
An error (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating a division by zero.

\section{\textit{Error} (concept)}
\textit{\color{orange}This section needs to be moved in Primordial Machine's Error library.}
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}[[}\\
An \textit{Error} type is a \texttt{error} or derived type.\\
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}]]}

\section{\textit{Exception} (concept)}
\textit{\color{orange}This section needs to be moved in Primordial Machine's Error library.}
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}[[}\\
An \textit{Exception} type is a \texttt{exception} or derived type.
Such an object must retain the properties of being
\begin{enumerate}
  \item noexcept copy/move constructible and
  \item noexcept copy/move assignable.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}]]}

\section{\texttt{negative\_overflow\_error} (struct)}
An \textit{Error} type (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating a negative overflow.
It raises its corresponding \texttt{negative\_overflow\_exception}.
The term negative overflow refers to the situation in which an arithmetic value is non-positive and
too big (in terms of its magnitude) to be represented. Its constructor takes a single argument which
is a \texttt{error\_position} value.

\section{\texttt{positive\_overflow\_error} (struct)}
An \textit{Error} type (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating a positive overflow.
It raises its corresponding \texttt{negative\_overflow\_exception}.
The term positive overflow refers to the situation in which an arithmetic value is non-negative and
too big (in terms of its magnitude) to be represented. Its constructor takes a single argument which
is a \texttt{error\_position} value.

\section{\texttt{underflow\_error} (struct)}
An \textit{Error} type (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating an underflow.
It raises its corresponding \texttt{underflow\_exception}.
The term underflow refers to the situation in which an arithmetic value is too small (in terms of
its magnitude) to be represented. Its constructor takes a single argument which
is a \texttt{error\_position} value.
