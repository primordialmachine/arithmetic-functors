\chapter{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing arithmetic functors and arithmetic errors and exceptions.
The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\chapter{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.

\chapter{Requirements}
This library depends on the \href{https://github.com/primordialmachine/errors}{Primordial Machine's Errors Library}.

\chapter{Introductory example}
\textit{\color{orange}This library does not provide any examples yet.}
%Examples are located in the \href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/examples}{examples} directory.

The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below.

\section{\texttt{square\_root\_functor} (struct)}
A \textit{FunctorBase} (see \cite{functors}) with one template parameter \texttt{A} and the
\texttt{ENABLED} parameter. Its specializations are unary  \textit{Functors}   representing
the operation $\sqrt[2]{\texttt{x}_0}$.\newline

\subsection{\texttt{square\_root} (function)}
This library provides a function to invoke the \texttt{square\_root\_functor}.
A possible implementation is given by\newline
\texttt{template\textlangle typename A\textrangle\newline
auto\newline
square\_root(const A\& a)\newline
noexcept(noexcept(square\_root\_functor\textlangle A \textrangle()(a)))\newline
-> decltype(square\_root\_functor\textlangle A\textrangle()(a))\newline
\{ return square\_root\_functor\textlangle A\textrangle()(a); \}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{division\_by\_zero\_error} (struct)}
An error (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating a division by zero.

\section{\textit{Error} (concept)}
\textit{\color{orange}This section needs to be moved in Primordial Machine's Error library.}
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}[[}\\
An \textit{Error} type is a \texttt{error} or derived type.\\
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}]]}

\section{\textit{Exception} (concept)}
\textit{\color{orange}This section needs to be moved in Primordial Machine's Error library.}
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}[[}\\
An \textit{Exception} type is a \texttt{exception} or derived type.
Such an object must retain the properties of being
\begin{enumerate}
  \item noexcept copy/move constructible and
  \item noexcept copy/move assignable.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textit{\color{orange}]]}

\section{\texttt{negative\_overflow\_error} (struct)}
An \textit{Error} type (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating a negative overflow.
It raises its corresponding \texttt{negative\_overflow\_exception}.
The term negative overflow refers to the situation in which an arithmetic value is non-positive and
too big (in terms of its magnitude) to be represented. Its constructor takes a single argument which
is a \texttt{error\_position} value.

\section{\texttt{positive\_overflow\_error} (struct)}
An \textit{Error} type (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating a positive overflow.
It raises its corresponding \texttt{negative\_overflow\_exception}.
The term positive overflow refers to the situation in which an arithmetic value is non-negative and
too big (in terms of its magnitude) to be represented. Its constructor takes a single argument which
is a \texttt{error\_position} value.

\section{\texttt{underflow\_error} (struct)}
An \textit{Error} type (as specified in Primordial Machine's Errors library) indicating an underflow.
It raises its corresponding \texttt{underflow\_exception}.
The term underflow refers to the situation in which an arithmetic value is too small (in terms of
its magnitude) to be represented. Its constructor takes a single argument which
is a \texttt{error\_position} value.
