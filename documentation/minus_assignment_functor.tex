\section{\texttt{minus\_assignment\_functor} (struct)}
A \textit{FunctorBase} (see \cite{functors}) with two template parameters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} followed by the \texttt{ENABLED} parameter.
Its specializations are \textit{Functor}s representing the binary operation $\texttt{a -= b}$.

\subsection{\texttt{minus\_assignment} (function)}
This library provides a function to invoke the \texttt{minus\_assignment\_functor}.
A possible implementation is given by\newline
\texttt{template\textlangle typename A, typename B\textrangle\newline
auto\newline
minus\_assignment(A\& a, const B\& b)\newline
-> decltype(minus\_assignment\_functor\textlangle A, B\textrangle()(a, b))\newline
\{ return minus\_assignment\_functor\textlangle A, B\textrangle()(a, b); \}}

\subsection{\texttt{operator+=} (compound operator)}
This library provides a compound minus operator overload to invoke the \texttt{minus\_assignment\_functor}.
A possible implementation is given by\newline
\texttt{template\textlangle typename A, typename B\textrangle\newline
auto\newline
operator-=(A\& a, const B\& b)\newline
-> decltype(minus\_assignment(a, b))\newline
\{ return minus\_assignment(a, b); \}}
